# MPI-Poisson-Project
This Repository consists of codes required to solve the 2D Poisson equation subject to varying boundary conditions. The codes are written in C and can be run on multiple processors organized in a parallel architecture. The MPI library was used in order to implement the parallelization functionality. MPI, a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. 

"MPI_Poisson_Jacob" implements the parallelized version of the Jacobi algorithm to solve the equation.
"MPI_Poisson_SOR" implements the parallelized version of the Succesive-Over-Relaxation algorithm to solve the equation.
